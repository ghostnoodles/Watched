        Seong Gi-hun, a divorced father and indebted gambler who lives with his elderly mother,
         is invited to play a series of children's games for a chance at a large cash prize. 
         Accepting the offer, he is taken to an unknown location where he finds himself 
         among 455 other players who are all in deep financial trouble. 
         The players are made to wear green tracksuits and are kept under watch at all times 
         by masked guards in pink jumpsuits, with the games overseen by the Front Man, who 
         wears a black mask and black uniform. The players soon discover that losing a game 
         results in their deaths, with each death contributing ₩100 million to the potential 
         ₩45.6 billion grand prize
