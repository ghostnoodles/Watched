    <p>
        The story follows professional thief Assane Diop, the only son of an
         immigrant from Senegal who had come to France to seek a better life for himself and
          his child. Assane's father is framed for the theft of an expensive diamond necklace by 
          his employer, the wealthy and powerful Hubert Pellegrini, and dies in his prison cell,
           leaving the fourteen-year-old Assane to fend for himself on the streets of Paris. 
           Twenty-five years later, inspired by a book about gentleman thief Arsène Lupin his father had 
           given him on his birthday, Assane sets out to get revenge on the Pellegrini family,
            using his charisma and mastery of thievery, subterfuge, and disguise to expose Hubert's crimes.
